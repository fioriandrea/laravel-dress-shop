# Dress Shop

Badly written dress shop for a university project.

## Technologies

The main framework used for the backend is Laravel, which is a shame in and of itself.
I was also forced to use bootstrap for the frontend, which makes the whole thing considerably bloated.
This is why performance is so bad.
